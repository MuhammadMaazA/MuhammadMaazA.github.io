Hi, I’m Muhammad Maaz, a passionate student of **Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI)** at University College London (UCL). Currently in my second year, I’m deeply interested in the intersection of **machine learning**, **automation**, and **data-driven solutions** to tackle real-world problems.

Through my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in programming (Python, C, and MATLAB), algorithms, and systems engineering. Outside the classroom, I actively explore projects in **machine learning**, **robotics**, and **data science**, blending theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience. I’m also a member of UCL's AI Society, Data Science Society, and FinTech Society, where I engage with like-minded peers and work on innovative ideas.

In my free time, I enjoy coding, mentoring peers in programming, and brainstorming entrepreneurial ventures. My personal mission is to build impactful technologies that create value for society, while continuously learning and improving along the way.

Feel free to explore my portfolio, projects, and publications listed on this site. If you’d like to connect, drop me an email or check out my social links below.
